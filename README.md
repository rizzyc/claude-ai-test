# Claude AI Test Repository

## Project Origin
This repository was created with the assistance of Claude AI, an AI assistant that helped me set up a new project workspace. The initial creation was guided by an AI tool, demonstrating the collaborative potential of AI in development workflows.

## My Coding Journey
As a front-end developer, I'm passionate about web technologies, with a strong background in TypeScript and Vue. Currently, I'm expanding my skillset by diving deep into React, embracing the challenges and excitement of learning a new framework. TypeScript has been my go-to language, providing the type safety and enhanced development experience that makes coding both more robust and enjoyable.

My goal is to continue growing as a developer, exploring new technologies, and building innovative web applications that push the boundaries of what's possible in front-end development.
